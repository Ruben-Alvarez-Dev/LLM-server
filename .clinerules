# Cline Rules for AI-server

version: 1

# Fixed context paths that must always be available
context:
  include:
    - "docs/context/"
    - "configs/"
    - "runtime/current_profile"
    - "Makefile"
    - "tools/"

# Exclude unnecessary files
exclude:
  - "node_modules/"
  - ".git/"
  - "*.log"
  - "*.tmp"

# Behavior notes
rules:
  - Always keep /docs/context and configs/* indexed for reference.
  - Use docs/context/manifest.json as the source of truth for key files.
  - Respect runtime/current_profile as the single active default profile.
  - Communication: chat in Spanish; code identifiers, comments, technical docs and commit messages in English.
  - Git: single branch 'main'; use English commit messages; prefer organic, meaningful commits.
  - Git author: if committing, set author to "Ruben-Alvarez-Dev <ruben.alvarez.dev@gmail.com>" (project policy).
  - ATLAS (if present): treat as black box; document only public interfaces; use 'atlas_' prefix for public names.
