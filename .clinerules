# Cline Rules for AI-server

version: 1

# Fixed context paths that must always be available
context:
  include:
    - "docs/context/"
    - "configs/"
    - "runtime/current_profile"

# Exclude unnecessary files
exclude:
  - "node_modules/"
  - ".git/"
  - "*.log"
  - "*.tmp"

# Behavior notes
rules:
  - Always keep /docs/context and configs/* indexed for reference.
  - Use docs/context/manifest.json as the source of truth for key files.
  - Respect runtime/current_profile as the single active default profile.
